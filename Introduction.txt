Hi I'm Rubin Antony James. I have 3 years of experience as a Business Analyst and have worked across technologies like SQL and Shell.
I also have worked on a few server side technologies such as Weblogic and Jboss.
I am very passionate about soccer and have played at numerous levels in my school, college and professional life. I also love to travel, especially hill stations and hiking spots.
One can always reach out to me on my email id : antony.rubin95@gmail.com.

I have previously worked with Version control system, but it was integrated with the IDE, hence, the usage of commands from terminal were minimal.
The concepts are relatable and hence easy to understand. Just need to brush up on the commands.
